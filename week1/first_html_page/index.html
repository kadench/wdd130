            Hi! My name is Kaden Hansen. This is my fourth semester as a student at BYU-I. I have my major set to Computer Science and I love to compose and listen to music (preferably classical). I like to play video games now and then, and I also like to work on different projects in my free time.

            Learning web design has many benifits. It grants work flexibility. Whether it be working from home or creating your own work schedule,you're able to create a unique and customizable workflow that fits your needs.

            One of the reasons I'm taking this class is because I would love to relearn HTML and CSS. I took three web design classes throughout my junior high and high school career. However, I did not use HTML and CSS enough to retain a high understanding of them, and I believe starting from the beginning may widen my understanding again. I've always loved web design and what you can do with it, but I've never really understood it. The last reason I'm taking this class is because it's a degree requirement.

        I have been a member of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints my whole life and I do not plan to leave. One of my favorite scripture passages is John 14:6. It states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."

            This verse constantly reminds me who Christ is and what He did for me. Jesus said this to Thomas, but it is meant for everyone. it's a constant reminder to give thanks to our Lord for allowing His Only Begotten Son to sacrifice Himself for each and every one of us. It's only through Jesus Christ that our salvation will occur. All we need to do in return is our best to follow Him.

            For those wondering, I have cerebral palsy. I had a brain hemorrhage at birth. This was caused by many complications between my twin and I. Basically, in the womb, we were sharing blood. This is known as twin-to-twin transfusion. so when we were born, I had most of our blood and my brother basically had none and was severely underdeveloped. All the blood that I had in my body rushed to my brain, giving me a grade 4 brain hemorrhage. The doctors believed this would leave me unable to talk, walk or move, but by some miracle, all the holes formed by the hemorrhage were gone by the time we went home. My twin brother had died when he was born, but the doctors were able to bring him back. We're both alive and well now.
